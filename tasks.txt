===============================
choose a language to develop on
===============================

- language needs to create software that either makes calls to underlying kernels or to be the kernel itself.
- no reinventing the wheel, so for the latter - a language in which a credible kernel exists already.

possible options: 
  a) Python - Openstack is sort of Re:Boot's cousin. Openstack is essentially a bunch of python scripts. 
  b) Go -     New and strong community.
  c) Rust
  d) C / C++
  
=====================
A usecase to fullfill
=====================

- A camera surveilance application that can use your android application OR a raspberry pi 2 with a camera module into your re:boot system. The mother device should connect with a linux application as the other slave system.
